### Milestone Readme
Thank you for reviewing my submission. I've designated this as a "#0.5" milestone because my solution resolves the errors in the console as required by the FLIP issue, but I'm still investigating how the project provider handles redirects via reach router. This might require refactoring, tho I'm not sure yet. For example, when loading the playground, 5 entries are added into the browser's history stack:
        http://localhost:3000/
        http://localhost:3000/local
        http://localhost:3000/LOCAL-project?type=account&id=LOCAL-account-0
        http://localhost:3000/?type=account&id=LOCAL-account-0
        http://localhost:3000/local?type=account&id=LOCAL-account-0

When I'm done looking into this further and if it turns out to be something that can be optimized, or if there are other related ways to optimize and/or refactor, I will make a second PR as milestone-#1 with the solution. Likewise, if it's fine the way it is then I will simply make a second PR as the milestone-#1 to complete my submission for this task.
