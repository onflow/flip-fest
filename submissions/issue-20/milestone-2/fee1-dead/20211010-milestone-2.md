# `flow-sdk` status update

See [the flow.rs repository](https://github.com/fee1-dead/flow.rs).

Instead of using `prost`, a new crate named `otopr` has been built from scratch.
Since `otopr` does not yet have the capability to generate Rust sources from `.proto` files,
entities are implemented by hand.
