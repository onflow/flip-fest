## CLI Feature: Project scaffolding - Milestone 1

## Description

This PR is for issue #31.

We add a new command `flow app create`. By this command, users can create a flow project based on [example scaffold](https://github.com/onflow/example-projects/tree/master/full-stack-basic) and setup stacks they want to use.
