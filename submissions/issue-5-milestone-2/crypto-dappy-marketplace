## PR Title

`CryptoDappy Feature: NFT marketplace - Milestone 2`

## Description

This PR is for issue #5.

- Provide a summary of the work completed in this PR.
 - List of requirements that are being submitted.

This pull request is in relation to Milestone 2 of the CryptoDappy Feature: NFT marketplace. It references all of the videos that I have produced (link below), as well as the branches for the tutorials. I have also included a link to the FlowMarketplaceEventMonitor repo. This is a repo that I created during FLIP Fest to help other people quickly and easily setup a serverless backend that will scan the blockchain for events.

I have provided 11 tutorial videos. In order and with their starting branches, these are:

1. Intro
2. StarterApplication
3. NFTStorefrontContract
4. DappyMarketContract
5. ListDappyOnMarket [Starting Branch: market-starter]
6. UpdateMaketBackend(Summary)
7. UpdateMarket  [Starting Branch: market-mission-2]
8. RemoveDappyFromMarket [Starting Branch: market-mission-3]
9. BuyDappyFromMarket [Starting Branch: market-mission-4]
10. BonusVideo-Deployment1 [Starting Branch: market-bonus-missions-deployment1]
11. BonusVideo-Deployment2 [Starting Branch: market-bonus-missions-deployment2]

The main content can be found in videos 1 to 9. The content in those is quite self-explanatory, they're essentially the walkthrough for converting the CryptoDappy application into the CryptoDappy Marketplace application. I have also included extensive educational comments in the DappyMarket contract and the sortDappies file, in the hope that they document some of my design choices and are a useful resource for other developers. The FlowMarketplaceEventMonitor repo also contains information that might help beginners to get started, the template.yaml file is also included so that they can deploy their own stack, and info is provided on how to use the repo. Finally, I have provided a summary video of the NFTStorefront contract, and a video on how this was adapted into the DappyMarket contract.

The bonus content is contained in videos 10 and 11. These cover:

* How to deploy a project to the blockchain
* How to update a deployed contract
* How to use the Flow CLI
* How to deploy the CloudFormation stack
* How to connect the stack to the frontend

I have also included a file in all the branches called CLI_Commands.md. This contains Flow CLI commands that I found myself using frequently and is useful for quick access. I talk about this file and how to use it in BonusVideo 1. 

There are also 7 new branches. In order, these are:

1. market-starter
2. market-mission-2
3. market-mission-3
4. market-mission-4
5. market-missions-finished
6. market-bonus-mission-deployment1
7. market-bonus-mission-deployment2

## Requirements Check

- Have have you met the milestone requirements? Yes
- Have you included tests (if applicable)? N/A
- Have you met the contribution guidelines of the repos you have submitted code to (if applicable)? Yes
- If this is the last milestone:
  - Demonstrate that you've met all the acceptance criteria (link to code, demos, instructions to run etc.) _See above_
  - Demonstrate that you've met all milestone requirements and highlight any extensions or additional work done. _I suppose that "additional work" would probably be the FlowMarketplaceEventMonitor and all its associated work (template.yaml, educational info etc), the educational comments in the DappyMarket contract and sortDappies file, the NFTStorefront video, and the 2 bonus videos and their content_
  - Include a payout structure by percentage for each team member (ie. Bob: 20%, Alice: 80%). _Phill (ph0ph0) 100%_

I have provided Ben with a document that covers all of the work that I have completed for this project. In summary, I produced 11 videos (2 of which were bonus content), 7 branches, extensive educational material and a repo that contains a serverless backend that can be used as an event monitor. 

## Other Details

- Is there anything specific you'd like the PoC to know or review for?
- Are there other references, documentation, or relevant artificats to mention for this PR (ie. external links to justify design decisions, etc.)?
