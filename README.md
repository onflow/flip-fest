# Welcome to Flow's FLIP Fest

This event is being moderated through [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/flip-fest/). If you interested in participating, please review all the details of the event and register through the link above.

## What is FLIP Fest?

The Flow FLIP Fest is a two-month event that will engage and reward participants for creating innovative and effective improvements to Flow's Ecosystem. A FLIP is a Flow Improvement Proposal; a community-driven initiative to discuss and execute impactful improvements on Flow.

Teams or individuals can sign-up to tackle high impact projects through any of the issues listed in this repository. Core contributors to Flow will aid and guide you through your project as you work to deliver an optimal solution alongside other teams.

Rewards are given per issue for both high quality completion as well as a large reward given to the best solution per project. Read more about the rewards [here](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/flip-fest/#prizes).
